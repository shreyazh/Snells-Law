# Snell-s-Law-Physics-Simulated-Lab

## Inspiration: Our physics teachers taught us to enjoy physics and we learned a variety of concepts through virtual labs, and we want to continue this by allowing people to continue to learn physics through these simulations.

## What it does: This simulation shows what would happen if a ray of light entered 3 different customizable mediums at a customizable angle of incidence.

## How we built it: Through javascript, we created the simulation

## Challenges we ran into: Issues with the raytracing and mathematics

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: The focus questions and the colored mediums, and the reflection when the angle of refraction is out of bounds.

## What we learned: We learned deep parts of the section of physics in Optics, and that the index of refraction is actually a complex number.

## What's next for Snell's Law Simulated Physics Lab: Expanding into a simulation of other aspects of optics, such as diffraction on curved surfaces, and/or a demonstration of the splitting of light through a prism, etc.
